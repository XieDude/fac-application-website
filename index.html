      <h1>Welcome to my Showcase</h1>
      <p>
        What started out as an inter-school wordpress site for me and my peers
        to share our thoughts and ideas has evolved into an obsession with
        Cybernetics and systems design. The web has proven itself as a
        playground for me to experiment with new technologies and exercise my
        creativity. Over the last few years, I have managed to turn these skills
        into a service, and have enjoyed my time working with local companies
        and organizations to build their websites, apps, and systems at large.
        My vision is to turn this into a career that is lucrative, yet
        stimulates my soul.

        <h2>Development Environment</h2>
        <p>
          I daily drive NixOS on my development PC, with VSCode as my IDE. I use
          Supermaven as my AI copilot. I have fallen in love with the
          declarative approach to administrating systems and software, and is
          definitely something I am to push going into the new year
